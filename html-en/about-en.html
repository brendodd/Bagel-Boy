          <h1>BAGEL BOY BACKGROUND</h1>
          <p>Brendan is from St Louis, Missouri, though his first venture into the bagel world was as a Front of House employee in a New Orleans’ bagel bakery. From FoH he moved into the kitchen, rolling bagel dough on the daily. In an effort to reduce food waste, Brendan took the initiative to cycle round the city and give away leftover bagels to friends and locals. On his way out one day, he heard a grateful ‘thanks, bagel boy’ from one of the recipients, and so the name stuck.</p>
          <p>With motivation running high, he had a go making his own, and making them vegan. He developed the perfect recipe and began his BagelBoyCo business from his kitchen, registering it in January 2017. It was his colorful Mardi Gras bagel that attracted the masses and got picked up by foodies around the world. His online following grew massively and in late 2017 he opened a kitchen space where he worked 7 days a week, selling to wholesalers and locals.</p>
          <p>After 3.5 years of single-handedly running BagelBoyCo in New Orleans, his studies led him to Amsterdam where he continued to make and sell bagels alongside his Masters. Here, he met his partner and together they moved to Barcelona in 2023.</p>
          <p>However, when finding work in software development proved difficult, Brendan decided to dust off his mixer and share his delicious bagels with his Catalan friends, who hadn’t yet experienced the beauty of a chewy NY-style bagel. He has now amassed a community of committed bagel-lovers in Barcelona and reestablished himself as the Bagel Boy.</p>
